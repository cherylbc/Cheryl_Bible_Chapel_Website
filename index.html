            <h2>Do You Have Peace with God?</h2>
            <p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:16</p>
            <p>For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. - Rom 3:23</p>
            <p>God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. - Rom 5:8</p>
            <p>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. - Rom 6:23</p>
            <p>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. - Rom 10:9</p>
