        <section>
            <p><strong>The Christians who gather together in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ at Cheryl Bible Chapel believe and teach that:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>All Scripture is verbally and plenarily inspired in the original manuscripts, and is therefore infallible and inerrant (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:21; Matthew 5:18; 1 Corinthians 2:13). We further believe that it is sufficient for all things pertaining to life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). The Scriptures are the Word of God! The Scriptures are the only inerrant, infallible, complete, authoritative, and sufficient Word of God.</li>
            <li>There is one living and true God who has always existed in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 4:35, 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).</li>
            <li>The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal God the Son, who took on human flesh, by being born of the virgin Mary (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38).</li>
            <li>The Lord Jesus Christ rose bodily from the dead and ascended into Heaven to sit at the right hand of God the Father ever making intercession for us (Matthew 28; Mark 16; 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 1:4).</li>
            <li>The Lord Jesus Christ will return:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>First, to the air for the "dead in Christ" who will be resurrected bodily; and for those Believers ("His Own") who are alive at His coming. This resurrection not only precedes the seven years of tribulation, but also precedes His return to earth to reign for one-thousand years (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).</li>
                <li>Then, to the earth to reign one-thousand years at the end of the seven years of tribulation (Revelation 20:1-6; 2 Timothy 2:12).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>All men inherit a depraved nature and are lost sinners in need of salvation (Romans 3:9-19; Ephesians 2:1-3).</li>
            <li>God has made salvation available to all mankind through offering the substitutionary death of His Son on the cross of Calvary , and allowing His blood to be shed to atone for their sins (Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9:22).</li>
            <li>Any person may be saved and justified when they recognized themselves as sinners deserving nothing but eternity in hell as the wage of their sin, repent of their sin and put their trust in Christ as the Son of God and His finished work on the cross of Calvary as substitutionary payment for their sin. Salvation is by grace through faith apart from any works plus nothing (Romans 3:24, 4:5; Ephesians 2:8-9).</li>
            <li>Once saved, we cannot be lost; we are eternally secure in Christ (John 6:37, 10:27-29; Romans 8:38-39; Ephesians 1:13, 4:30; PhilippiÂ¬ans 1:6).</li>
            <li>The baptism of the Holy Spirit takes place at the time of conversion and is the act of placing the believer into the body of Christ. It is not a second work of grace (1 Corinthians 12:13; Galatians 3:27). It is different than the filling of the Holy Spirit which is an ongoing process that occurs as the believer yields his or her life to Christ (Ephesians 5:18). Neither of these aspects is accompanied by unusual signs such as speaking in tongues.</li>
            <li>There are two ordinances given by the Lord Jesus Christ to His Church:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Baptism: Done once in obedience - following conversion to Jesus Christ. All Believers should be baptized by immersion as an act of obedience. This act of obedience has no part in securing their salvation or in making them part of this or any other local church.</li>
                <li>Communion: Done weekly in remembrance - by believers only - as the Lord Jesus Christ requested, "This DO in remembrance of me". This time of remembrance is spontaneously led by the Holy Spirit. All male believers meeting requirements for fellowship (see distinctive 1.a. below) are welcome to take audible part, leading the congregation in corporate worship of God. The ladies are not to lead, but to participate silently and veiled (see #12 below). An offering is taken from believers at this time as a part of their corporate worship, the amount representing their appreciation of God's provision for them (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:19-20; John 13:12-30; 1 Corinthians 10:16-22, 11:1-16, 23-32; 14:34-40; 1 Timothy 2:9-15).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Men and women are equal in all ways in the sight of God.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>They both were created in God's image (Genesis 1:27) to rule the world for God (Genesis 1:28); share the consequences of sin (Genesis 3); need salvation in Christ (Romans 3:19-20); are on the same level before God (Galatians 3:28); receive the Holy Spirit at salvation (1 Corinthians 12:12-13). Once saved, men and women are royal and holy priests before God to worship and serve Him (1 Peter 2:5,9); are gifted by the Holy Spirit for worship and service within the body of Christ, His Church (1 Corinthians 12:7).</li>
                <li>They do, however, have different roles and ministries. The ladies are to remain silent in the Church (1 Corinthians 14:34; 1 Timothy 2:11-12). This means that, while they are encouraged to participate corporately (e.g. singing and reading), they are not to exercise verbal gifts (teaching/preaching) or take authority over or lead men in meetings of the church. As a visible demonstration of a lady's submissive heart in these matters, she is directed by Scripture to cover her head, thereby veiling the man's glory (her), and her glory (her hair), in the presence of God and His image and glory (the man) (1 Corinthians 11:1-16). She should therefore have her head covered by a veil or a hat during official church services (1 Corinthians 11:2-10; Ephesians 3:10; 1 Timothy 5:21).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The Bible teaches the eternal blessedness of the saved (John 4:14, 5:24; Ephesians 2:7). It also teaches the eternal conscious punishment of the lost (John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:10,15; Matthew 25:46).</li>
            <li>The grace of God teaches us to "live soberly, righteously, and godly" (Titus 2:11-13).</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Titus 2:13 -- "Looking for that blessed hope" of His returning for us.</li>
                <li>Colossians 3:2-3; 1-John 2:15-17 -- Setting our "affections on things above, not on things on the earth."</li>
                <li>2 Corinthians 6:14:18 -- Living a life of separation from sin and the world.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The calling of the local Church is not to call the world into the Church, but rather to call the Church out of the world. The Church should be separated "unto God" (Romans 1:1, 16:17; 2 Corinthians 6:17-18; 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 3:6; 1 Timothy 6:3,5).</li>
            <li>The local Church is called to:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to all the world, beginning at home.</li>
                <li>Make disciples of all nations.</li>
                <li>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</li>
                <li>Teaching them to observe all things directed by God in His Word.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The local Church accomplishes its calling:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>By gathering together (faithfully/steadfastly) for teaching, fellowship (joint participation), breaking of bread (communion), and prayer.</li>
                <li>By going out empowered by the Holy Spirit to reach the lost.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Those things which distinguish Cheryl Bible Chapel from most other local churches are that we are a New Testament local Church, not just in principle, but in practice. This means that, in addition to the truths outlined above, we believe and practice the following New Testament teachings:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Church Reception</li>
            <ol>
                <li>We are non-denominational and welcome all believers to meet with us in our local fellowship. The only requirements for fellowship are that they be: born again; sound in doctrine; holy in life; not under discipline either locally or from another local Church; happily submissive to our elders and deacons; active and consistent in attendance and participation.</li>
                <li>Denominationalism, as well as any other man made division of the Church, is not a Biblical concept. In fact it is forbidden in Scripture and given as an indication of Spiritual immaturity and carnality.</li>
                <li>We take no name which might exclude other believers, or indicate that we are the only believers.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Church Guidance. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>We take no human authority over the local Church (the local Church is autonomous). Our direction comes only from the Lord Jesus Christ and His Word.</li>
                <li> We have no headquarters except Heaven.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The Holy Spirit is the representative (Vicar) of Jesus Christ in the Church.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The Holy Spirit leads and guides the local body of believers in all facets of worship and service.</li>
                <li>He guides and directs both positively and negatively.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The Church of God is holy.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The believer is called to a life of practical righteousness. We are to maintain a life separated from sin and the world. We are in the world, but not of the world.</li>
                <li>Church discipline is exercised to encourage the believers to maintain this standard.</li>
                <li>This local Church exercises church discipline through it's elders, the final authority in spiritual matters within the local Church. Their function is to spiritually lead and guide the local assembly of believers, to mediate and judge differences and disagreements, and generally act as God's human instruments for spiritual oversight.</li>
                <li>This local Church normally recognizes church discipline carried out by other like minded local churches. It is not our function to judge the actions taken by the elders of other meetings, but merely to support their decisions.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Spiritual gifts are given to the Church for its edification.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>We believe that all believers are given spiritual gifts for the edification of the overall fellowship.</li>
                <li>We believe that the "sign" or "miraculous" gifts (tongues, healings, miracles, etc.) were intended to verify God's Word and God's servant before the Scripture was complete. They do not (normally) function today.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>All Believers are priests of God.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>We believe that all believers have a function within the body of Christ.</li>
                <li>All believers are one in Christ, and on an equal basis. There is no clergy or laity.</li>
                <li>The only offices given the local Church in the New Testament are a plurality of elders raised up by the Holy Spirit, and deacons recognized by the believers and "pointed out" by the elders.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
